## Eleventy Configuration

Eleventy configuration is abstracted from the typical `.eleventy.js` file and moved to `/src/config/` for easy organization and configuration of collections, filters, passthroughs, etc.

## Install project dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

## Run the project locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build for staging

(The same as production except every page is flagged `noindex`)

```bash
npm run staging
```

## Build for production

```bash
npm run production
```
